ASSIGNMENT  : ( Date: 18-04-22) 

TOPIC: Mongoose Populate and Reference

For this assignment the session branch is session/populate-reference
For the solution you have to create a new branch in your own repo- assignment/populate-reference2
Try to use your own mongodb Atlas clusters to avoid sharing of collections and thus errors, please make sure you write the schema correctly. Use these collection names - developers, batches

A batch document looks like this.
{
	_id: ObjectId("65321bfa4d9fe0d34da86829"),
	name: “Uranium”,
	size: 250,
	program: “backend”
}
A developer document should look like this
{ 
	_id: ObjectId("61951bfa4d9fe0d34da86829"),
	name:"Sabiha Khan",
	gender:”female”,
	percentage:75,
	batch: ObjectId("65321bfa4d9fe0d34da86829")
}

1. Write an api POST /batches that creates a batch from the details in the request body. Please note that the program should be an enum with the following allowed values only - backend and frontend
2. Write an api POST  /developers that creates a developer from the details in the request body. Please note that the gender should be an enum with the following allowed values - male, female and other. Also, batch attribute is a reference to the batches collection.

3. Write an api GET /scholarship-developers that fetches the list of eligible developers for scholarship. An eligible developer is female with percentage greater than or equal to 70

4. Write an api GET /developers?percentage=value1&program=value2 that only returns the developers for a given program with a percentage greater than or equal to the received value. Please note the batch name and the program values are received in the request as query params.

For example GET /developers?percentage=55&program=radium should return all the developers from radium batch with a percentage greater than or equal to 55
